# SVG Logo Maker

## Description

Your task is to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in user input to generate a logo and save it as an [SVG file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics). The application prompts the user to select a color and shape, provide text for the logo, and save the generated SVG to a `.svg` file.

## User Story

```
AS a freelance web developer
I WANT to generate a simple logo for my projects
SO THAT I don't have to pay a graphic designer
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for text
THEN I can enter up to three characters
WHEN I am prompted for the text color
THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
WHEN I am prompted for a shape
THEN I am presented with a list of shapes to choose from: circle, triangle, and square
WHEN I am prompted for the shape's color
THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
WHEN I have entered input for all the prompts
THEN an SVG file is created named `logo.svg`
AND the output text "Generated logo.svg" is printed in the command line
WHEN I open the `logo.svg` file in a browser
THEN I am shown a 300x200 pixel image that matches the criteria I entered
```

## What was my motivation?

To apply the concepts I learned on node.js, inquierer prompts, constructors, classes, inheritance, polymorphism, jest, and testing.

## Why did I build this project?

To test my knowledge and continue to learn the object oriented programming.

## What problem does it solve?

This helps business professionals quickly create their own logo without paying a premium for a graphic designer.

## What did you learn?

That you can make many shapes with SVG. You can validate the input length and other measures of an input.

## What makes your project stand out?

Well organized, passing tests, multiple classes with inheritance, shape specific renders - pixel perfect.
